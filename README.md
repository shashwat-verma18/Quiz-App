# Quiz-App

It ia a open-source project. I created a quiz app which checks your programming skills like Java, C++ and Python. The quiz consists of 10 questions without any time constraint.
The app consists of 3 layouts - first is the main screen asking for your name and let you choose a language, next is the quiz page consisting of different questions and the last one is the result page that shows your score.
